## Reflection 1
I have applied most of the clean code principles that I've learned this week to my code in this tutorial. 
Firstly, I have written my variables and arguments to be meaningful and self-descriptive. Secondly, 
I have written my functions to be small, using descriptive names, and applied command query separation. 
Then, I have written my codes with the right layout and formatting.

I have found a mistake in my `ProductList.html` where I wrote comments instead of explaining it through my code. 
I think I can fix it by stating a class for the delete and edit button.

## Reflection 2
1. I feel like I have to practice more on writing unit tests because I'm still a little bit confused when 
writing it. The number of tests we should write depends on how many features we have and how complex it is. 
Having a 100% code coverage doesn't mean our code is guaranteed having no bugs and errors. Code coverage 
only measures the percentage of code that is executed by our tests. Our tests can also have bugs or errors 
and does not guarantee that all possible execution paths or scenarios have been tested.
